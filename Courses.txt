Why are you applying for financial aid?
Hello,
I am Testimony, a 4th year student studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Nigeria. I really love learning; I find joy in discovering new things. I would really love to be a Robotics Engineer in the nearest future.
I am applying for this financial aid as I would love to further my skills by learning C#. I believe this course is a good way to start. 
I am a student and I do not have the monetary capabilities to pay for  this course and that is why I am applying for this financial aid.  Also, my parents are both lecturers in a federal college, but federal and state universities in my country are on a strike action. This means that for the past 5-6 months, my parents have not been paid salaries. So I can't ask  them for money to take this course.
I would really be grateful if I am given a financial aid to take this course.
Thank you!

How will your selected course help with your goals?
I love learning and I take every opportunity possible to learn. I recently started learning Robotics Process Automation with UiPath and I discovered that I need some C# knowledge to adequately write codes with UiPath. This course will help me to write codes to perform certain tasks that UiPath activities can't do, then I will Invoke the codes I've written with C# into the UiPath process I'm working on.
Learning this course will also help me understand how UiPath works better as it was built with C#. Previously, I have had to go to Stack Overflow to copy and paste codes with C# when I need them. This doesn't work most times as I do not understand the language and I wouldn't know what to change for the C# code to work.
I believe learning C# will make building processes with UiPath easier for me to do and also enable me to perform tasks I can't do currently.
